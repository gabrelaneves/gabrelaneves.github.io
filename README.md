# Work Experience

## Software Engineer Expert at Pixida
**Aug 2024 - Present**

As a software engineer expert at Pixida, I architect and develop systems for the BMW Group QA team, focusing on assessing the quality of the maps provided to the vehicles. My responsibilities span end-to-end solution development on AWS infrastructure, covering backend, frontend, data engineering, and DevOps. Key responsibilities include:

- Architecting systems that process and analyze vast geospatial datasets to provide insights on maps quality.
- Developing backend services in Python and Node.js, while implementing intuitive and responsive frontends in React.
- Managing data ingestion pipelines, data integration, and processing workflows for geospatial data.

**Stack:** AWS, Python, Node.js, React, Github Actions, Serverless Framework, ECS, Docker, EMR, Geoserver, PostgreSQL.

## Software Engineer at Hashdex
**Apr 2022 - Aug 2024**

As the primary software engineer for internal services and backend infrastructure, I developed a microservices ecosystem critical to Hashdex's operations, specializing in managing crypto assets. My role spanned architecture, development, and maintenance of systems supporting key business functions. Key projects included:

- **Asset Portfolio Management Platform**: Co-designed and developed a core internal system to manage asset portfolios, tracking financial events like trades, transfers, and allocations. Using an event-driven architecture, this platform leverages Eventuous to support historical tracking and immutable record-keeping, with a Command API for seamless service communication.

- **HR Management System**: Developed an HR platform with a VueJS-based UI (using Quasar) and Strapi for CMS functionalities. Designed hierarchical access controls ensuring visibility based on team and position, secured with VPN access, OAuth (Cognito), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- **Automated Workflow Routines**: Built automated workflows using AWS Step Functions and Lambda, significantly reducing manual workloads. Each workflow is encapsulated within Docker images stored in ECR to overcome Lambda storage constraints.

- **Trading Bots and Notifications**: Developed bots for platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack to streamline OTC trading auctions, content dissemination, and internal alerts.

- **Trading System Integrations**: Maintained and implemented new trading system integrations, enabling efficient bulk order placements and balance monitoring across exchange REST APIs. Utilized AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of sensitive information.

- **Market Data System**: Maintained Marketdata, a real-time data ingestion and availability application for asset prices and volumes. Leveraged AWS EKS pods for data ingestion via third-party WebSockets, processed via Kinesis and Firehose, and stored in AWS Timestream and Redis for low-latency querying.

**Stack:**  Python, C#, Vue, NodeJS, Javacript, Github Actions, EventStoreDB, MongoDB, Serveless Framework, Docker, AWS.
  
## Developer Intern at Santander Brasil
